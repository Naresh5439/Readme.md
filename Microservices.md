# agentserver-sandbox
# What is it?
 A backend service that manages and coordinates agents deployed across the system.

# Why we use it?
 It helps in handling requests from agents, managing configurations, distributing tasks, or collecting data from agents.

# When to use it?
 When your application relies on multiple agents running tasks, monitoring, or collecting telemetry data.

# Telemetry data : Telemetry data is information collected remotely from systems, devices, or processes to monitor their performance, behavior, or status. Itâ€™s typically gathered automatically and transmitted in real-time or periodically for analysis. Think of it like a fitness tracker reporting your steps or a car sending engine data to a mechanic.
