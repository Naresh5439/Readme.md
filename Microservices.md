# agentserver-sandbox
# What is it?
 A backend service that manages and coordinates agents deployed across the system.

# Why we use it?
 It helps in handling requests from agents, managing configurations, distributing tasks, or collecting data from agents.

# When to use it?
 When your application relies on multiple agents running tasks, monitoring, or collecting telemetry data.

# Telemetry data 
Telemetry data is information collected remotely from systems, devices, or processes to monitor their performance, behavior, or status. It‚Äôs typically gathered automatically and transmitted in real-time or periodically for analysis. Think of it like a fitness tracker reporting your steps or a car sending engine data to a mechanic.










# Cohort Agents
## What are Cohort Agents?
Imagine you and your friends are working on a group project.
Each of you has a specific role: one collects data, one makes slides, one explains, one designs.
Together, as a cohort (team), you all finish the project faster and better.
Now, in computers, a Cohort Agent is like one "friend" in that team.
Each agent is a small program (robot brain) that does one job.
When we put many agents together (a cohort), they can solve big problems by dividing the work.
So, Cohort Agents = A team of smart mini-programs working together.

# Real-Time Work of Cohort Agents
Cohort Agents are like a team of mini-AIs (or helpers) inside your app.
In real-world projects, they can be used for things like:

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Collection & Processing
Agent 1 ‚Üí Goes to websites and collects data.
Agent 2 ‚Üí Cleans and organizes the data.
Agent 3 ‚Üí Stores it in a database.
üëâ Example: A news aggregator app where agents collect news from multiple websites, clean it, and show you only the latest news.












# Metrics Server
## What is Metrics Server?
Think of your Kubernetes cluster like a school playground:
Many students (pods) are running around doing activities (CPU, memory, etc).
The PE teacher (Metrics Server) is standing with a stopwatch and notebook, measuring how much energy each student is using.
üëâ Metrics Server = A monitoring tool in Kubernetes that collects CPU and memory usage of pods and nodes.
üí° Why do we need Metrics Server?
Because Kubernetes itself doesn‚Äôt know how much CPU or memory is being used right now.
We need those numbers for:
Autoscaling ‚Äì If a pod is too busy (high CPU), Kubernetes can create more pods automatically.
Monitoring ‚Äì To see which pod is consuming more memory or CPU.
Better Decisions ‚Äì Like scheduling workloads to less busy nodes.
üëâ Without Metrics Server, Kubernetes can‚Äôt scale pods automatically using Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA).
