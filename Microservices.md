# agentserver-sandbox
# What is it?
 A backend service that manages and coordinates agents deployed across the system.

# Why we use it?
 It helps in handling requests from agents, managing configurations, distributing tasks, or collecting data from agents.

# When to use it?
 When your application relies on multiple agents running tasks, monitoring, or collecting telemetry data.

# Telemetry data 
Telemetry data is information collected remotely from systems, devices, or processes to monitor their performance, behavior, or status. It’s typically gathered automatically and transmitted in real-time or periodically for analysis. Think of it like a fitness tracker reporting your steps or a car sending engine data to a mechanic.


# Cohort Agents
## What are Cohort Agents?
Imagine you and your friends are working on a group project.
Each of you has a specific role: one collects data, one makes slides, one explains, one designs.
Together, as a cohort (team), you all finish the project faster and better.
Now, in computers, a Cohort Agent is like one "friend" in that team.
Each agent is a small program (robot brain) that does one job.
When we put many agents together (a cohort), they can solve big problems by dividing the work.
So, Cohort Agents = A team of smart mini-programs working together.

# Real-Time Work of Cohort Agents
Cohort Agents are like a team of mini-AIs (or helpers) inside your app.
In real-world projects, they can be used for things like:

## 1️⃣ Data Collection & Processing
Agent 1 → Goes to websites and collects data.
Agent 2 → Cleans and organizes the data.
Agent 3 → Stores it in a database.
👉 Example: A news aggregator app where agents collect news from multiple websites, clean it, and show you only the latest news.
